# Rhizomer

Rhizomer is a web application for interactive exploration of semantic and linked data available from SPARQL endpoints.
With Rhizomer, lay users can explore datasets performing the 3 data analysis tasks:

* *Overview*: get the full picture of the data set at hand
  Rhizomer generates a wordcloud to provide an overview of the kinds of things in the dataset.
  Future work is to generate other overview components like site map, site index or treemap.

* *Zoom & Filter*: zoom in on items of interest and filter out uninteresting items
  Once a class is selected, Rhizomer generates a faceted view.
  It zooms in and allows filtering resources of the chosen type based on their properties.
  Future work is to also allow pivoting among classes through facets.

* *Details*: after zooming and filtering the user arrives at the resources of interest
  All properties and values are shown for every selected resource.
  It is also possible to browse linked resources.
  Future works it to include visualisations like maps or timelines.

## Examples

If you are interested in testing Rhizomer with your own data, you can request and account.

## Install

It is also possible to deploy your own copy of Rhizomer. The source code is available from GitHub:

* **RhizomerEye**: frontend developed with Angular, source code available from https://github.com/rhizomik/rhizomerEye
* **RhizomerAPI**: backend developed using Spring, source code available from https://github.com/rhizomik/rhizomerAPI

There are also Docker images available from Docker Hub and a [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/rhizomik/rhizomerAPI/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) to deploy the backend and
another [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/rhizomik/rhizomerEye/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) for the frontend.
